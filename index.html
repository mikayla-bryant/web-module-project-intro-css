      <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, 
        the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
      
      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, 
        but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, 
        grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

          This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span class = "bold">current fire restrictions</span>.</p>
